# wrld bot
A simple Python bot that pulls Juice WRLD info using [juicewrldapi.com](https://juicewrldapi.com). You can use it publicly, or self-host your own version to tweak however you like.  

I canâ€™t promise this bot will always stay updated. I mainly made it for fun as an open-source alternative to [moonlight](https://discord.gg/YTWdnuNTbk) by yash, [hh wrld](https://discord.gg/P5nCDdMnBV) by hunter, and other Juice WRLD bots. I donâ€™t really expect it to blow up, so for now itâ€™ll stay completely free to use.  

Made in [Pycord](https://pycord.dev/)

## Invite
If you just want to use the public bot, you can [invite it here](). Otherwise, keep reading to learn how to build it yourself.  

# Usage
Coming soon.  

# Building
If you want to host wrld yourself: 
1. WRLD is written in [pycord](https://pycord.dev/), a discord.py fork. Please ensure its installed (instructions below)
2. Download the repo as a `.zip` and extract it.  
3. Create a file named `.env` and paste the following:  
```env
BOT_TOKEN=
DEV_TOKEN=
```
4. Paste your botâ€™s token into `BOT_TOKEN`. Leave `DEV_TOKEN` blank unless youâ€™re going to use a separate dev bot.
5. Run `start.bat` and youâ€™ll have your own instance running!

### Pycord Installation
WRLD is written in [pycord](https://pycord.dev/). Here's how you can install it:
1. Uninstall discord.py:
```bash
pip uninstall -y discord && pip uninstall -y discord.py
```
3. Install Pycord:
```bash
pip install py-cord
```
Done!

Pycord is a great fork of discord.py. If you're interested in using it, you can [get started here](https://guide.pycord.dev/introduction)

### Dev Mode
If you want to run a separate dev bot alongside your main one:
1. Make sure youâ€™ve done the steps above.  
2. Paste your dev botâ€™s token into `DEV_TOKEN`.  
3. In `config.py`, set `DEV = True`.  

**Note:** With `DEV = True`, the bot will default to the dev token on startup. To switch back to your main bot, just change it back to `False`.  

Youâ€™re free to make your own public bot with this, but I just ask that you give me (pure) credit somewhere on the bot.  

## Site Access
When the site first launched, an access code was given out, but months later I couldnâ€™t find it (after some lazy searching). So I did the next best thingâ€¦ some super simple reverse engineering.  

The code ended up being inside [62d43f4b.js](https://juicewrldapi.com/assets/index.62d43f4b.js).  
**The access code is `juicetracker`.**  
(easily guessable ngl, but I didnâ€™t bother guessing lol)
